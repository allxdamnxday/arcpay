California 2024 PIT Withholding: Method B - Exact Calculation Guide
This document provides a summary of the key data and steps required to implement the "Method B - Exact Calculation Method" for California Personal Income Tax (PIT) withholding for 2024. This method provides a precise withholding amount and can be automated. 



The primary document for determining California withholding allowances is the 

DE 4 form. If an employee does not provide a withholding certificate, you must use the "Single with Zero" withholding allowance status. 


The 5-Step Calculation Process
The process involves five sequential steps to determine the final withholding amount for an employee for a given payroll period. 

Determine Low-Income Exemption: Check if the employee's gross wages for the payroll period are less than or equal to the amount in Table 1. If they are, no income tax is withheld. 



Subtract Estimated Deduction Allowance: If the employee claims additional allowances for estimated deductions on a DE 4 form, subtract the corresponding amount from Table 2 from the gross wages. 


Subtract Standard Deduction: Subtract the standard deduction amount from Table 3 based on the employee's payroll period and filing status. The result is the employee's taxable income. 


Compute Tax Liability: Using the taxable income from Step 3, find the applicable tax bracket and formula in Table 5 for the employee's payroll period and filing status. Calculate the computed tax. 


Subtract Exemption Allowance Credit: From the computed tax, subtract the tax credit amount found in Table 4. This is based on the number of regular withholding allowances. The result is the final amount of tax to be withheld. 



Note: Do not use additional allowances claimed for estimated deductions to determine this tax credit.
